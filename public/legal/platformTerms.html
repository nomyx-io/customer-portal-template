		<p>We have updated Nomyx's Main Services Agreement (formerly called the Master Subscription Agreement). If You
			are a new Subscriber, this Main Services Agreement is effective as of November 1, 2023. If You are an
			existing Subscriber, Nomyx is providing You with prior notice of these changes which will be effective as of
			July 1, 2023. For the previous version of Nomyx's Main Services Agreement, please click <a
				href="https://www.nomyx.io/company/agreements">here</a>. For a PDF version of this Main Services
			Agreement, please click <a href="https://www.nomyx.io/company/agreements">here</a>. If You are acquiring a
			subscription to a Service operated by Nomyx from an unrelated third party authorized to sell such
			subscriptions under a separate agreement with Nomyx, the terms of this Main Services Agreement shall be null
			and void, and the terms and conditions that govern Your access to and use of the Service are found <a
				href="https://www.nomyx.io/company/agreements">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="notice">
			<p><strong>THIS AGREEMENT IS A BINDING CONTRACT AND GOVERNS THE USE OF AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES BY YOU,
					AGENTS AND END-USERS WHETHER IN CONNECTION WITH A PAID SUBSCRIPTION OR FREE TRIAL FOR THE
					SERVICES.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<p>By accepting this Agreement, either by accessing or using a Service, or authorizing or permitting any Agent
			or End-User to access or use a Service, Subscriber agrees to be bound by this Agreement as of the date of
			such access or use of the Service (the "Effective Date"). If You are entering into this Agreement on behalf
			of a company, organization or another legal entity (an "Entity"), You are agreeing to this Agreement for
			that Entity and representing to Nomyx that You have the authority to bind such Entity and its Affiliates to
			this Agreement, in which case the terms "Subscriber," "You," or "Your" herein refers to such Entity and its
			Affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree with this Agreement, You must not use
			or authorize any use of the Services. Subscriber and Nomyx shall each be referred to as a "Party" and
			collectively referred to as the "Parties" for purposes of this Agreement.</p>

		<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions under which Subscriber may purchase
			Nomyx's Services and Professional Services as described in a Service Order, Statement of Work or other
			document signed or agreed to by the Subscriber.</p>

			of any Service Order or Statement of Work, the terms of the Service Order or Statement of Work shall
			control. Non-English translations of this Agreement are provided for convenience only. In the event of any
			ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version shall control.</p>

		<h2>ACCESS TO THE SERVICES</h2>

		<h3>Service</h3>
		<p>Nomyx will make the Services and Service Data available pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Service
			Order(s) and Documentation in accordance with Subscriber's Service Plan. Nomyx will use commercially
			reasonable efforts to make the Services available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week,
			except during (a) Planned Downtime (of which Nomyx will give advance notice via the Site or to the Account
			owner); and (b) Force Majeure Events.</p>

		<h3>Support</h3>

		<p> Upon Subscriber's request, Nomyx may provide Professional Services subject to the terms and conditions
			stated at: <a href="https://www.nomyx.io/company/agreements"
				target="_blank">https://www.nomyx.io/company/agreements</a></p>
		<h3>Modifications</h3>
		<p>Subscriber acknowledges that Nomyx may modify the features and functionality of the Services during the
			Subscription Term. Nomyx shall provide Subscriber with thirty (30) days' advance notice of any deprecation

			the Services purchased by Subscriber during the Subscription Term.</p>
		<h3>Additional Features</h3>

			contractors or service providers acting on Subscriber's or Subscriber's Affiliates' behalf, provided that
			Subscriber remains responsible for their compliance hereunder. An Affiliate may also directly purchase
			Services or Professional Services pursuant to the terms of this Agreement provided that such Affiliate (i)
			executes a Service Order or Statement of Work for such Services or Professional Services; and (ii) agrees to
			be bound by the terms of this Agreement as if it were an original party hereto. Subscriber also agrees that
			it will be responsible for its Affiliates' compliance with this Agreement. Subscriber hereby authorizes

	<section id="use-services">
		<h2>USE OF THE SERVICES</h2>

		<h3>Login Management</h3>
		<p>Access to and use of certain Services is restricted, such as to the specified number of individual Agents
			permitted under Subscriber's subscription to the applicable Service, as detailed in the Documentation. For
			Services that are Agent-based, Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that an Agent Login cannot be shared or
			used by more than one (1) individual per Account. However, Agent Logins may be reassigned to new individuals
			replacing former individuals who no longer require ongoing use of the Services. Subscriber and Agents are
			responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Agent Login information for an Account. Absent a
			written license from Nomyx expressly stating otherwise, Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that Subscriber
			may not use the Services, including but not limited to the API, to circumvent the requirement for an
			individual Agent Login for each individual who (a) leverages the Services to interact with End-Users; (b)
			processes data related to interactions with End-Users; or (c) processes data related to interactions
			originating from a Non-Nomyx Service that provides functionality similar to functionality provided by the
			Services and which would, pursuant to this Agreement, require an individual Agent Login, if utilizing the
			Services for such interaction. Further, Subscriber shall not use the API or any Software in such a way to
			circumvent applicable Service Plan restrictions or Agent licensing restrictions that are enforced in the
			Service user interface. Nomyx reserves the right to charge Subscriber, and Subscriber hereby agrees to pay,
			for any overuse of a Service in violation of this Agreement or the Service Plan features and limitations on
			the Site or Documentation, in addition to other remedies available to Nomyx.</p>

		<h3>Compliance</h3>
		<p>Subscriber agrees to comply with the Nomyx User Content and Conduct Policy (as defined below) which is hereby
			incorporated into this Agreement. Further, in Subscriber's use of the Services Subscriber agrees not to (a)
			modify, adapt, or hack the Services or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or
			related systems or networks; (b) attempt to bypass or break any security or rate limiting mechanism on any
			of the Services or use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity, security
			or performance of the Services and its components; (c) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or
			otherwise discover the source code of any Software making up the Services; or (d) to the extent Subscriber
			is subject to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing
			regulations (HIPAA), use the Services to store or transmit any "protected health information" as defined by
			HIPAA, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Nomyx.</p>

		<h3>System Requirements</h3>
		<p> A high-speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Services. Subscriber is
			responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Subscriber's network to the
			Services including, but not limited to, browser software that supports protocols used by Nomyx, including
			the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol or other protocols accepted by Nomyx, and to follow procedures
			for accessing services that support such protocols. Nomyx is not responsible for notifying Subscriber,
			Agents or End-Users of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of
			data, including Service Data, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities
			(including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Nomyx. Nomyx
			assumes no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this
			Section.</a></p>

		<h3>Internal Business Purposes Only</h3>
		<p>Unless otherwise authorized by Nomyx in this Agreement or expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Nomyx,
			Subscriber may not use the Services in any manner where Subscriber acts as a service bureau or provides any
			outsourced business process services on behalf of more than one (1) third party (other than Affiliates)
			through a single Account. This provision is not intended to prevent or inhibit the use of the Services to
			provide business support to multiple End-Users; however, Subscriber agrees not to license, sublicense, sell,
			outsource, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time-share or otherwise commercially exploit or resell
			the Services to any third party, other than authorized Agents and End-Users in furtherance of Subscriber's
			internal business purposes as expressly permitted by this Agreement, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in
			writing by Nomyx. Without limiting the foregoing, Subscriber's right to access and use the API is also
			subject to the restrictions and policies implemented by Nomyx from time to time with respect to the API as
			set forth in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to Subscriber in accordance with this Agreement.
		</p>

		<h3>No Competitive Access</h3>
		<p>Subscriber may not access the Services for competitive purposes or if Subscriber is a competitor of Nomyx.
		</p>

		<h3>Provision</h3>
		<p>The provision and use of certain Services are subject to Nomyx's Service-Specific Terms.</p>

		<h3>Region-Specific Supplemental Terms</h3>
		<p>The provision and use of the Services in certain jurisdictions are subject to Nomyx's Region-Specific Terms.
		</p>

		<h3>In-Product Cookies</h3>
		<p>Whenever Subscriber, its Agents or End-Users interact with the Services, Nomyx's In-Product Cookie Policy
			applies.</p>

	<section id="term-cancellation">
		<h2>TERM, CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</h2>

		<h3>Term</h3>
		<p>The term of this Main Services Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will remain in effect as long as
			the Subscriber has a valid Service Order/Statement of Work or until this Main Services Agreement is
			otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, whichever occurs first. The Subscription Term will
			be defined in each individual Service Order. Unless an Account and subscription to a Service are terminated
			in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Service Order, or unless otherwise stated in the
			applicable Service Order, (a) Subscriber's subscription to a Service (including any and all Deployed
			Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then-expiring
			Subscription Term; and (b) the Subscription Charges applicable to any subsequent Subscription Term shall be
			Nomyx's Standard Subscription Charges for the applicable Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services at
			the time of such renewal.</p>

		<h3>Cancellation</h3>
		<p>Either Party may elect to terminate an Account and subscription to a Service at the end of the then-current
			Subscription Term by providing notice in accordance with Section 18 of this Agreement to <a
				href="mailto:legal@nomyx.io">legal@nomyx.io</a> no
			less than sixty (60) days prior to the end of such Subscription Term</p>

		<h3>Termination for Cause</h3>
		<p>A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material
			breach by the other Party if such breach remains uncured after thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
			such notice; or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other
			proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
			However, Nomyx may immediately terminate this Agreement for cause without notice if Subscriber violates the
			Nomyx User Content and Conduct Policy or if provision of the Service violates applicable law, regulation or
			court order.</p>
		<p>Nomyx will refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term as of the effective date
			of termination if this Agreement is terminated by Subscriber in accordance with this Section for Nomyx's
			uncured material breach.</p>
		<p>Subscriber must pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all
			applicable Service Order if Nomyx terminates this Agreement for Subscriber's material breach in accordance
			with this Section. In no event will Nomyx's termination for cause relieve Subscriber of its obligation to
			pay any fees payable to Nomyx for the period prior to termination.</p>

		<h3>Payment Upon Termination</h3>
		<p>Except for Subscriber's termination under Section 3.3, if Subscriber terminates its subscription to a Service
			or cancels its Account prior to the end of the then-effective Subscription Term, or if Nomyx terminates or
			cancels Subscriber's Account pursuant to Section 3.3, in addition to any other amounts Subscriber may owe
			Nomyx, Subscriber must immediately pay any and all unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder
			of such Subscription Term.
		</p>

		<h3>No Refunds</h3>
		<p>Except for Subscriber's termination rights under Section 3.3, no refunds or credits for Subscription Charges
			or other fees or payments will be provided if Subscriber terminates a subscription to a Service or cancels
			its Account prior to the end of a Subscription Term.
		</p>

		<h3>Export of Service Data</h3>
		<p>Upon Subscriber's written request, Nomyx will make Service Data available to Subscriber for export or
			download as provided in the Documentation for thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination,
			expiration or migration of the Account, except for Service Data which (i) has been deleted in accordance
			with the Documentation, (ii) was created and/or used in violation of this Agreement, or (iii) unless
			prohibited by law or legal order. Thereafter, Nomyx will have no obligation to maintain or provide any
			Service Data and Nomyx will delete Service Data in accordance with Nomyx's Service Data Deletion Policy
			available on Nomyx's Agreement and Terms Website unless prohibited by law or legal order.

	<section id="billing-payments">
		<h2>BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</h2>

		<h3>Payment and Billing</h3>
		<p>Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, a Service Order, a Statement of Work, or in
			Supplemental Terms, or as otherwise agreed for Usage Charges, all Subscription Charges are due in full upon
			commencement of the Subscription Term, or with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such
			Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed. Subscriber is responsible for
			providing valid and current payment information and Subscriber agrees to promptly update the Account
			information, including payment information, with any changes that may occur (for example, a change in
			Subscriber's billing address or credit card expiration date). If Subscriber fails to pay Subscription
			Charges or any other charges indicated on any Service Order or Statement of Work, or in any Supplemental
			Terms, within five (5) days of Nomyx's notice to Subscriber that payment is delinquent, or if Subscriber
			does not update payment information upon Nomyx's request, in addition to other remedies, Nomyx may suspend
			access to and use of the Services by Subscriber, Agents and End-Users. As permitted by applicable law, Nomyx
			reserves the right to charge the Subscriber late payment penalties or interest charges on any past-due
			invoices that are not subject to a previously-noticed good faith dispute as to amount owed.</p>

		<h3>Upgrades</h3>
		<p>If Subscriber chooses to upgrade the Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and
			use a Service during the Subscription Term, any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such
			upgrade will be charged in accordance with the remaining Subscription Term. In any subsequent Subscription
			Term, the Subscription Charges will reflect any such upgrades.</p>

		<h3>Downgrades</h3>
		<p>Subscriber may not downgrade its Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents during any Subscription Term.
			Subscriber may only downgrade its Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents under any Service Plan for a
			subsequent Subscription Term at the end of the then-current Subscription Term by providing Nomyx with thirty
			(30) days prior written notice indicating which instances will be affected and the details of the downgrade
			requested. In the event of a downgrade, Subscriber must demote any downgraded Agents prior to the beginning
			of the subsequent Subscription Term. Downgrading the Service Plan may generate additional costs (e.g.,
			storage costs) and cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to Subscriber
			under an Account, and Nomyx is not responsible for such loss. If a new Service Order is not signed by the
			Subscriber before the end of the then-current Subscription Term, the Services will renew as defined in
			Section 3.1.</p>

		<h3>Taxes</h3>
		<p>Unless otherwise stated, Nomyx's Subscription Charges do not include any Taxes. Subscriber is responsible for
			paying Taxes assessed in connection with the subscription to the Services except those assessable against
			Nomyx measured by its net income. Nomyx will invoice the Subscriber for such Taxes if Nomyx believes it has
			a legal obligation to do so and Subscriber agrees to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. Nomyx agrees to exempt
			Subscriber from any taxes for which Subscriber provides to Nomyx a tax exemption certificate prior to the
			issuance of an invoice; provided, however, that no such exemption shall be extended to Subscriber following
			written notice to Nomyx from a taxing authority of appropriate jurisdiction that Subscriber does not qualify
			for the claimed exemption.
		</p>
		<p><b>5.4.1</b> If the Subscriber is required to withhold Taxes from payments to Nomyx, Subscriber shall pay
			Nomyx the
			amount owing on the invoice, less a deduction for such Taxes withheld to be remitted directly by the
			Subscriber to the relevant tax authority. Subscriber will provide Nomyx with a valid receipt for such Taxes
			remitted to the relevant tax authority within 75 (seventy-five) days of Subscriber's payment to Nomyx from
			which the withholding was made. If Subscriber does not provide the valid receipt for such Taxes remitted
			within 75 days, Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that it will be charged and will have to pay for the full
			amount of the invoice.</p>

		<p><b>5.4.2</b> If the Subscriber is legally required to withhold Taxes from payments to Nomyx but fail to do so
			and
			pay an invoice in full, Subscriber may be entitled to reimbursement of the Taxes which should have been
			withheld. Such reimbursement can only be made in the first year following payment of the relevant invoice to
			Nomyx, once the Subscriber provides Nomyx with a valid receipt for the Taxes remitted to the relevant tax
			authority in respect of that invoice.</p>

		<h3>Payment Agent</h3>
		<p>If Subscriber pays by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface
			for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). Payments made by credit
			card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Nomyx Service are billed and processed by
			Nomyx's Payment Agent. Subscriber hereby authorizes the Payment Agent to bill Subscriber's credit card or
			other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for
			the Services, and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which
			Subscriber subscribes until the subscription to the Services terminates, and Subscriber further agrees to
			pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. If applicable, Subscriber hereby authorizes Nomyx and the Payment
			Agent to charge Subscriber's credit card or other payment instrument to establish prepaid credit. The
			Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may
			obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status. To the extent the Payment Agent is
			not Nomyx, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Nomyx
			and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service. The Payment Agent uses a third-party
			intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use
			Subscriber's billing information except to process Subscriber's credit card information for the Payment
			Agent.
		</p>

		<h3>Payment Portals</h3>
		<p>If Subscriber mandates Nomyx to use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal that charges Nomyx a
			subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required cost of doing business, Subscriber
			shall be invoiced by Nomyx for, and Subscriber is obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.
		</p>

		<h3>Promotional Credits</h3>
		<p>Any promotional credits issued hereunder will be subject to the Nomyx Promotional Credits Policy available on
			the Nomyx Agreements and Terms Website.

		<h2>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>

		<p>In connection with the Services, each Party will protect the other's Confidential Information from
			unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each Party protects its own Confidential
			Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this
			Agreement, each Party may use the other Party's Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective
			rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential
			Information (a) solely to the employees and/or non-employee service providers and contractors who have a
			need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by terms of confidentiality intended to prevent
			the misuse of such Confidential Information; (b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any
			administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any
			applicable law or regulation. Except for Nomyx's Security Non-Disclosure Agreement (where executed by
			Subscriber), the provisions of this Section 5 shall control over any non-disclosure agreement by and between
			the Parties and any such non-disclosure agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to the
			exchange of Confidential Information after the execution of this Agreement. This section shall not apply to
			any information which (a) was publicly known prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing Party, or (b)
			becomes publicly known after such disclosure through no action or inaction of the receiving Party in
			violation of this Agreement. For clarity, any exchange of Confidential Information prior to the execution of
			this Agreement shall continue to be governed by any such non-disclosure agreement. Given the unique nature
			of Confidential Information, the Parties agree that any violation or threatened violation by a Party to this
			Agreement with respect to Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the other Party.
			Therefore, the Parties agree such violation or threatened violation shall entitle the other Party to seek
			injunctive or other equitable relief in addition to all legal remedies.</p>

		<h2>SUB-PROCESSORS AND SECURITY OF SERVICE DATA</h2>

		<h3>Sub-processors</h3>
		<p>Nomyx will utilize Sub-processors who will have access to or process Service Data to assist in providing the
			Services to the Subscriber. Subscriber hereby confirms and provides general authorization for Nomyx's use of
			the Sub-processors listed within Nomyx's Sub-processor Policy. Nomyx shall be responsible for the acts and
			omissions of members of Nomyx Personnel and Sub-processors to the same extent that Nomyx would be
			responsible if Nomyx was performing the services of each Nomyx Personnel or Sub-processor directly under the
			terms of this Agreement. Subscriber may sign up to receive notifications of any changes to the Sub-processor
			Policy within the policy webpage.
		</p>

		<h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
		<p>Nomyx may use third-party service providers that are utilized by Nomyx to assist in providing the Services to
			Subscriber, but do not have access to Service Data. Any third-party service providers utilized by Nomyx will

		<h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

		<h3>Indemnification by Nomyx</h3>
		<p>Nomyx will indemnify and defend the Subscriber from and against any claim brought by a third party against
			Subscriber alleging that Subscriber's use of a Service as permitted hereunder infringes or misappropriates a
			third party's valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an "IP Claim"). Nomyx shall, at Nomyx's
			expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against Subscriber in connection therewith,
			including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys engaged by Nomyx for such defense, provided that (a)
			Subscriber promptly notifies Nomyx of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) Nomyx will have sole,
			exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim
			(however, Nomyx shall not settle or compromise any claim that results in liability or admission of any
			liability by Subscriber without Subscriber's prior written consent); and (c) Subscriber fully cooperates
			with Nomyx in connection therewith. If use of a Service by Subscriber, Agents or End-Users has become, or,
			in Nomyx's opinion, is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Nomyx may, at Nomyx's option and
			expense (i) procure for Subscriber the right to continue using the Service(s) as set forth hereunder; (ii)
			replace or modify a Service to make it non-infringing; or (iii) if options (i) or (ii) are not commercially
			reasonable or practicable as determined by Nomyx, terminate Subscriber's subscription to the Service(s) and
			repay Subscriber, on a pro-rata basis, any Subscription Charges paid to Nomyx for the unused portion of
			Subscriber's Subscription Term for such Service(s). Nomyx will have no liability or obligation under this
			Section 12.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (x) compliance with
			designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by Subscriber; (y) modification of the Service(s) by
			anyone other than Nomyx or Nomyx Personnel; or (z) the combination, operation or use of the Service(s) with
			other hardware or software where a Service would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section
			12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Nomyx to Subscriber and Subscriber's sole remedy with
			respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of a Service by Subscriber, Agents or
			End-Users.</p>

		<h3>Indemnification by Subscriber</h3>
		<p>Subscriber will indemnify, defend and hold Nomyx harmless against any claim brought by a third party against
			Nomyx (a) arising from or related to Subscriber, Agents' or End-Users use of a Service in breach of this
			Agreement (and not arising solely from the Service itself); or (b) alleging that Subscriber Marks or content
			selected by Subscriber in the design and implementation of the Services, including but not limited to the
			URL, graphics, illustrations, logos, and marks, or Service Data infringes or misappropriates a third party's
			valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret; provided that (i) Nomyx promptly notifies Subscriber of

			to select defense attorneys, and to defend and/or settle any such claim (however, Subscriber shall not
